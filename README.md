# Gradle and Maven plugin for implementing Sequencing.com's OAuth2 and File Selector in Java applications

This repo contains a Gradle and Maven plugin that will quickly add Sequencing.com's OAuth2 authentication and File Selector to your Java application. This will allow your app to securely connect to and use Sequencing.com's APIs and [App Chains](https://sequencing.com/app-chains/). 

For OAuth flow reference see [here](https://github.com/SequencingDOTcom/OAuth2-code-with-demo).

This module allows quick integration of Sequencing.com oAuth support to Gradle and Maven based applications
* Java based web applications ([plain Servlet example](https://github.com/SequencingDOTcom/OAuth2-code-with-demo/tree/master/java-servlet), [Spring and Spring Boot example](https://github.com/SequencingDOTcom/OAuth2-code-with-demo/tree/master/java-spring))
* Android applications ([example](https://github.com/SequencingDOTcom/OAuth2-code-with-demo/tree/master/android))
